## Technical Issue

All Notebooks using Keras 2.2.4 and Tensorflow 1.11. Batch-Norm layer in this version of Keras is implemented in a way that: during training your network will always use the mini-batch statistics either the BN layer is frozen or not; also during inference you will use the previously learned statistics of the frozen BN layers. As a result, if you fine-tune the top layers, their weights will be adjusted to the mean/variance of the new dataset. Nevertheless, during inference they will receive data which are scaled differently because the mean/variance of the original dataset will be used. Consequently, if use Keras's example codes for fine-tuning Inception V3 or any network with batch norm layer, the results will be very bad. Please refer to issue [#9965](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/pull/9965) and [#9214](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/9214). One temporary solution is: 

```python
for layer in pre_trained_model.layers:
    if hasattr(layer, 'moving_mean') and hasattr(layer, 'moving_variance'):
        layer.trainable = True
        K.eval(K.update(layer.moving_mean, K.zeros_like(layer.moving_mean)))
        K.eval(K.update(layer.moving_variance, K.zeros_like(layer.moving_variance)))
    else:
        layer.trainable = False
```
